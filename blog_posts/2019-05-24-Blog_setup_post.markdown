Life, as we all know it, is bound to throw at us some hurdle because of which we end up opening a Pandora's box of new(sometimes wholesome) experiences while looking for its solution. For me, this hurdle presented itself in the form of my Intro to Machine Learning course final assignment. I was required to test and compare the Bayesian vs frequentist methods of learning. I had some experience with the latter method, but the Bayesian approach was utterly new to me. My search for getting a working model led me to [**PyMC3**](https://docs.pymc.io/). After playing around with pymc3 and getting a model working, my next job was to present my data. Here is when I came across [**ArviZ**](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz), and the timing couldn't have been better. 

Soon my semester came to an end, and I ended up spending the better part of my two-week long winter-break knowing more about ArviZ. The open source environment in my university is reasonably prevalant, and I like many of my peers, wanted to enter the Google Summer of Code program for the upcoming summer. I saw that ArviZ was planning to put up a project under the NUMFOCUS umbrella, and I made up my mind as to which project I was going to contribute. While going through their experimental projects, the one about applying [**Numba**](https://numba.pydata.org/) to speed up the code caught my interest. Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Forget the developers or the sophisticated engineers; I am yet to come across a normal human being who would say no to a computational speedup. Plus ArviZ, which handles large datasets, could surely benefit from a gain of a few milliseconds or so. 

So here I am finally, after two months of contributing and writing proposals as an accepted student of the GSoC 2019 program with NUMFOCUS. All I can say is I am excited about this summer. Wish me luck!!
